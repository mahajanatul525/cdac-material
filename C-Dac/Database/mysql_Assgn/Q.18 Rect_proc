q.18Write a stored procedure by the name of RECT_PROC that computes the perimeter and the area of a rectangle.
The length and width are to be passed as parameters. (Assuming that L and W are the length and width of the rectangle, 
Perimeter = 2*(L+W) and Area = L*W). The stored procedure should display the perimeter and the area on the screen using dbms_output.put_line. 
Calling program for the stored procedure need not be written.


CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `Rect_proc`(length double,width double,out perimeter double,out area double)
BEGIN
set perimeter:=2*(length+width);
set area:=length*width;
END



call Rect_proc(3,5,@perimeter,@area)
select @perimeter
select @area
