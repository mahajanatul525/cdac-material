JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML:

JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.

Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

Example
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;


Accessing Object Properties
You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName
or

objectName["propertyName"]
Extracting String Parts
There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:

slice(start, end)//negative is allowed
substring(start, end)//negative is not allowed,
substr(start, length)//negative is not allowed same as slice
