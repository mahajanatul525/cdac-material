1) using cin and cout, accept name,address,age of a person and print it.

2) write a function which can accept minimum 3 characters and maximum 5 characters and display them.

3) create following structure
struct book
{
	char bid[5];
	char name[30];
	int price;
};
ask user how many records he wants to create and accordingly allocate memory.
accept values from user and display.
( Hint :-  use  "new" operator)

4)write a function which will return reference of structure.
( note:- any structure of ur choice u can define )

5)write a function which takes 3 arguments
variable, pointer and a reference.(any datatype)
invoke this function and show how "call by value","call by address" and "call by reference" will work.

6)define 3 different structures and initialize their members.
now write 3 different functions,but with the same name.
these functions will accept each structure respectively and display their members.

7)define 2 functions
a) function which accepts another function as an argument
( using pointer to function )
b) function which accepts another function as an argument
( using reference to function )
	try to invoke both the functions and display the output.

8)accept 2 numbers and swap them using references.

9)accept 2 names and swap them using references.



10) create an Entity "Employee" using structure
with members and member functions.
now access it using
a) array 
b) DMA

11) create a library in c in which,
write a function which will accept 2 numbers and return the difference between 2 numbers
write appropriate header file.

write c++ client code to access this library.
