	Memory leak

when pointer is pointing to some heap memory.once the scope of that pointer variable is over, it is removed. but the memory to which it was pointing remains ......... (till the program execution comes to an end)



	Dangling Pointer

when pointer is pointing to some heap memory.After using that memory, we apply "delete" on that pointer in order to release memory. Now heap memory is released but the pointer pointing to that memory remains ......... (till the scope of that pointer variable is not over)
