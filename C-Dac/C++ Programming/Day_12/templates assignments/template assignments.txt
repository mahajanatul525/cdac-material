1) write a function template,which can accept anything as an argument and display it.
It can also accept "Emp" class object as an argument.


2) write a function template,which can accept argument as any type of array( char,int or double) and sort it in ascending order.

3) write a function template which will accept 3 different types of argument and return the total size of arguments passed.

4) write a class (not a class template) and inside it create a function template which will display one argument and display what type of argument it is.

5) write a class template , which can take any generic type display it and return the size of type passed.
(hint : in this class template write two functions void disp() and int size() ).

6) write a class template, which can take 3 different type of arguments and print them.
a class must be having only one constructor and that is a constructor which will take 3 arguments.
class must be having disp function which will display the data.

7) write a class template, which can take 3 different type of arguments.
a class should not have any constructor.
class must be having 3 setter methods and 3 getter methods.

8)write a class template which will take 2 same type of data and compare them.
if first is greater than second return 1 viceversa return -1. if both are same return 0;
for that in this class template there should be 
a compare() function.
Also there will be a paramterized constructor.
	Above class template u need to create in such a way that it can be reused in multiple applications.

Now create first application where,

class MyNum
{	
	private:
		int num;
	// other code
};
void main()
{
	// call compare function by passing 2 instances of MyNum
}

second application where,

class MyChar
{
	private:
		char ch;
	// other code
};
void main()
{
	// call compare function by passing 2 instances of MyChar
}
