abstract class

abstract class is a class having at least one pure virtual function.

pure virtual function is the one which is declared (using virtual keyword) and not defined.

abstract class can not be instantiated but pointer or reference to abstract class can be created.

Along with pure virtual function, abstract class may contain virtual as well as non-virtual functions.

child class of an abstract class has to define pure virtual function declared in parent class.
