Suppose we allocate a chunk of memory and store its address in a pointer. If this chunk of memory is freed and if the pointer continues to point to that location,the pointer is said to be a dangling pointer.
e.g.

void main()
{
	int *ptr=new int[3];
	// make use of ptr
	delete ptr;
	// still some more statements to execute
	........
	......
}



In the above example," delete ptr", would free the allocated memory making "ptr" a dangling pointer.
