1) create a class with constructors and destructors.
create array of instances and observe how program behaves.


2) create a class with constructors and destructor.
create 2 instances on stack and 1 instance on heap. observe the invocation of constructors and destructors.

3) create a class "book" with
int bookid
char *bookname
int price

define parameterized constructor only for this class.
define 3 getter functions.

now create 2 instances
1 on stack and 1 on heap.
pass the necessary values while creating instances.
call the getter functions.


4)create a class "MyClass1"
with members and member function "disp1().
create another class "MyClass2"
with members and member function "disp2().
now try to invoke disp1() from disp2()
in the main() function, create instances of both the classes and invoke their member functions.

5) create a class.
accept from user, how many instances are required.
Accordingly create array of instances dynamically.
Now make sure that u call destructor for each and every instances.

6) create a class, define different types of constructors. in main create n number of objects. At the end display how many constructors are created for a class.
