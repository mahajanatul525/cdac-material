1)Create a base class Storage_Device. Declare pure virtual function “void save()” in it. 			
Define following sub classes for this class.                       A) PenDrive  b) CD  c) HD		                                       	
	Define a global function “perform” which will accept “Storage_Device’s reference as an argument. Inside this method u will check , if  “Storage_Device” contains “HD”, then only u will call “save()” method. 
( RTTI).
				From main function , try calling display function by passing all the child instances one by one.

2)Create a base class Advertisement. Declare pure virtual function “void publish()” in it. 			
Define following sub classes for this class.                       			A) TV  b) Banner  c) NewsPaper		                                       	
	in main function, create an array of pointer to "Advertisement" and store addresses of all the child classes.
now traverse through the array and check using dynamic cast , if array contains "Banner" , then only invoke "publish()" .( RTTI).

3) Define a class "Player" with following members
	int id;
	char *name;
	char *country
	int score


	in the main function, u should be able to say

	
	Player p1(1,"sachin","india",200);

	cout<<p1<<endl;

	p1.disp();

	Player p2=p1;
	
	cout<<p2<<endl;

	Player p3;

	p3=p1;
