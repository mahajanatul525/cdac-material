/*Q11.	Read a five-letter word into the computer, then encode the word on a letter-by-letter basis by
subtracting 30 from the numerical value that is used to represent each letter. Thus if the ASCII
character set is being used, the letter a (which is represented by the value 97) would become a C
(represented by the value 67), etc.
Write out the encoded version of the word. Test the program with the following words: white, roses,
Japan, zebra.*/
