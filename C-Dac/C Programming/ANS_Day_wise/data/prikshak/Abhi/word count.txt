You have to write a program to count the number of words in the input. The program should read in the input text till end_of_file (EOF) and output the number of words found. A word can be taken to be a sequence of alphanumeric characters terminated by a space or by a newline. Assume that there will not be any characters other than alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and white spaces (blank, tabs and newlines) in the input.














#include <stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    int wordStarted = 0;
    int wordCount = 0;
    char alpha;

    while ((alpha=getchar()) != EOF) {
        if ( alpha=='\r'  || alpha=='\t' || alpha=='\n' ) {
            wordStarted = 0;
        } else if ((alpha!='\t' && alpha!='\r' && alpha!='\n') && !wordStarted) {
            wordStarted = 1;
            wordCount++;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", wordCount);

    return 0;
}
