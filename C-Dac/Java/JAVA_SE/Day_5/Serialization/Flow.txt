importance of Object Persistence


when u serialize

	take heap-based object convert into sequence of bytes, write them inside File-System [ Serialization ]

when u need to retrieve the state of an object

	open file, read the sequence of bytes , convert them into full fledged heap-based object [ Deserialization ]




how to serialize
	class implement Serializable or Externalizable

		members- serialized


		Serializable - marker interface
		
		Externalizable extends Serializable
			
			readExternal and writeExternal

example of Serializable

	Entire object graph is serialized
		non-static and non-transient members
		SerialversionUID [ generated automatically by jvm if not declared explicitly by programmer ]

		transient

	Serialization and inheritance


serialversion info

	how does it work- InvalidClassException

recommendation for SerialVersionUID
	declare it inside ur class explicitly


Externalizable
	need

	example
		constructor invocation incase of deserialization



		Externalizable

Serialization and inner class
