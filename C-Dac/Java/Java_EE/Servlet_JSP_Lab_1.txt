create a servlet "StudentServ" which will retrieve all the records from "Student" table, while traversing through the ResultSet create objects of "Student" class per record and store them in ArrayList. now store this ArrayList inside request attribute and forward the request to "Stud.jsp".
"Stud.jsp" will use JSTL tag "foreach" in order to traverse through the ArrayList.
