FacesServlet will perform following as part of its initialization part i.e. (init() method of FacesServlet will perform following :)

	a) loading and parsing of faces-config.xml
	b) FacesServlet will prepare lifecycle object

	in lifecycle object number of phases are available:

Restore view
Apply request values
process validators
update model values
invoke applications
render response






it just creates a lifecycle object, it does not perform any lifecycle. The entire process happens at server startup and not at the first request.
