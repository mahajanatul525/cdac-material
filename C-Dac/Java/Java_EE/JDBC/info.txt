According to jdbc 4.0 , no need explicitly load the "jdbc driver" using 
Class.forName("drivername")
	or
DriverManager.registerDriver(new driverclassname)

instead u need to

a) create following directory structure inside current directory

	META-INF
		services

b) inside "services" folder , create the file by the name , "java.sql.Driver".

c) in this file write the name of driver class  e.g.  com.mysql.jdbc.Driver  or oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
