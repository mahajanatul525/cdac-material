Declaration Context. You can use ReadOnly only at module level. This means the declaration context for a ReadOnly element must be 
a class, structure, and cannot be a source file, namespace, or procedure.

Combined Modifiers.

Assigning a Value. Code consuming a ReadOnly property cannot set its value. 
But code that has access to the underlying storage can assign or change the value at any time.

You can assign a value to a ReadOnly variable only in its declaration or in the constructor of a class or structure 
in which it is defined.




When to Use a ReadOnly Variable

There are situations in which you cannot use a Const Statement (Visual Basic) to declare and assign a constant value.

 For example, the Const statement might not accept the data type you want to assign, or
 you might not be able to compute the value at compile time with a constant expression. 
 You might not even know the value at compile time.
 In these cases, you can use a ReadOnly variable to hold a constant value.
