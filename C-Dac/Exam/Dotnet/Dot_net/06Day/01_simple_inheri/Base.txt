The base keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:

Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.

Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.

A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.

It is an error to use the base keyword from within a static method.
