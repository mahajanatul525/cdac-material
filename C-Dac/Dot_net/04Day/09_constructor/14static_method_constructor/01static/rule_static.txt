There are several restrictions that apply to static methods:

• A static method does not have a this reference. This is because a static method does
not execute relative to any object.

• A static method can directly call only other static methods of its class. It cannot
directly call an instance method of its class. The reason is that instance methods
operate on specific objects, but a static method is not called on an object. Thus, on
what object would the static method operate?
• A similar restriction applies to static data. A static method can directly access only
other static data defined by its class. It cannot operate on an instance variable of its
class because there is no object to operate on.


It is important to understand that a static method can call instance methods and access
instance variables of its class if it does so through an object of that class. It is just that it
cannot use an instance variable or method without an object qualification
