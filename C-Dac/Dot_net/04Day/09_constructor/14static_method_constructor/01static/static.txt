->static class
Following are the main features of a static class:

They only contain static members.

They cannot be instantiated.

They are sealed.

They cannot contain Instance Constructors  




When to use static class

Suppose you have a CompanyInfo class that contains the following methods to get information about the company name and address

Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited. They cannot inherit from any class except Object
. Static classes cannot contain an instance constructor; however, they can have a static constructor. 


static constructor  can not be parameterised
only one static constructor allowes per class 
no acess modifier allowed


->static member

A static method, field, property, or event is callable on a class even when no instance of the class has been created

static methods and properties can only access static fields and static events

Static methods can be overloaded but not overridden.

Static members are initialized before the static member is accessed for the first time and before the static constructor, if any is called.



 To access a static class member, use the name of the class instead of a variable name to specify the location of the member.
