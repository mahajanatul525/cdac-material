Instance Methods vs. Static Methods as Event Handlers
Although both instance methods and static methods can be used as event handlers, they do
differ in one important way. 
When a static method is used as a handler, an event notification applies to the      class. 

When an instance method is used as an event handler, events are sent to
specific object instances. 
Thus,   each object of a class    that wants to receive an event notification must register individually.

 In practice, most event handlers are instance methods, but, of
course, this is subject to the specific application.
