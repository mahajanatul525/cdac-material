 Managed Code

Managed Code in Microsoft .Net Framework, is the code that has executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) environment. On the other hand Unmanaged Code is directly executed by the computer's CPU. Data types, error-handling mechanisms, creation and destruction rules, and design guidelines vary between managed and unmanaged object models.

The benefits of Managed Code include programmers convenience and enhanced security . Managed code is designed to be more reliable and robust than unmanaged code , examples are Garbage Collection , Type Safety etc. The Managed Code running in a Common Language Runtime (CLR) cannot be accessed outside the runtime environment as well as cannot call directly from outside the runtime environment. This makes the programs more isolated and at the same time computers are more secure . Unmanaged Code can bypass the .NET Framework and make direct calls to the Operating System. Calling unmanaged code presents a major security risk.
