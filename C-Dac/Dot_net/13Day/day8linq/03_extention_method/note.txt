Linq standard query operators(select,where etc) are implemented in Enumerable class as extension methods on the IEnumerable<T> interface.

List<int> numbs =new List<int> {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
IEnumerable<int> Evennumbs=numbs.where(n=>n%2==0);


where method is not belong to List<T> class still we are able to use it because  where method is implemented as extention method in IEnumerable<T> interface and List<T> implements IEnumerable<T> interface





What is Extention methods
It enables you to "add" methods to existing type without creating a new derrived type,recompiling
it is special kind of static method but used as if instance method
