/*You can also use the TaskFactory.StartNew method to create and start a task in one operation. Use this method when creation and scheduling do not have to be separated and you require additional task creation options or the use of a specific scheduler, or when you need to pass additional state into the task through its AsyncState property, as shown in the following example.*/
