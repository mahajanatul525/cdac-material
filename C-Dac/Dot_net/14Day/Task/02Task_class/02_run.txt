You can also use the Task.Run methods to create and start a task in one operation. To manage the task, the Run methods use the default task scheduler, regardless of which task scheduler is associated with the current thread. The Run methods are the preferred way to create and start tasks when more control over the creation and scheduling of the task is not needed. */
