The IsBackground Property
As mentioned earlier, the .NET Framework defines two types of threads: foreground and
background. The only difference between the two is that a process won’t end until all of its
foreground threads have ended, but background threads are terminated automatically after
all foreground threads have stopped. By default, a thread is created as a foreground thread.
It can be changed to a background thread by using the IsBackground property defined by
Thread, as shown here:
public bool IsBackground { get; set; }
To set a thread to background, simply assign IsBackground a true value. A value of false
indicates a foreground thread.
