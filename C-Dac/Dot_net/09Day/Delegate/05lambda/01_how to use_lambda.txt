Expression Lambdas
In an expression lambda, the expression on the right side of the => acts on the parameter (or
parameters) specified by the left side. The result of the expression becomes the result of the
lambda operator and is returned.

n => n % 2 == 0
In this case, this expression returns true if n is even and false if it is odd.

To use a lambda expression involves two steps.
 First, declare a delegate type that
is compatible with the lambda expression. 

Second, declare an instance of the delegate,
assigning to it the lambda expression. 

Once this has been done, the lambda expression can
be executed by calling the delegate instance. The result of the lambda expression becomes
the return value.
