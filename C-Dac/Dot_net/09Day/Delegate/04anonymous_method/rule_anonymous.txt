• An anonymous method cannot access ref or out parameters of the defining
method.
• An anonymous method cannot have a local variable with the same name as a local
variable in the outer method.
• An anonymous method can access instance variables (or static variables, as
appropriate) in the outer class scope.
• An anonymous method can declare local variables with the same name as outer
class member variables (the local variables have a distinct scope and hide the
outer class member variables).
