Multicasting
One of the most exciting features of a delegate is its support for multicasting.
 In simple
terms, multicasting is the ability to create an invocation list, or chain, of methods that will be
automatically called when a delegate is invoked. Such a chain is very easy to create. 

Simply
instantiate a delegate, and then use the + or += operator to add methods to the chain. 


To
remove a method, use – or – =. 

If the delegate returns a value, then the value returned by
the last method in the list becomes the return value of the entire delegate invocation. Thus,
a delegate that makes use of multicasting will often have a         void           return type.
