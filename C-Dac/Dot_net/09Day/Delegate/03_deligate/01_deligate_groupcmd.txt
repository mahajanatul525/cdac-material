Since version 2.0, C# has included an option that significantly simplifies the syntax that
assigns a method to a delegate. This feature is called method group conversion, and it allows
you to simply assign the name of a method to a delegate, without using new or explicitly
invoking the delegate’s constructor.


static void Main() {  
  // Construct a delegate using method group conversion. 
  StrMod strOp = ReplaceSpaces; // use method group conversion 
  string str; 
 
  // Call methods through the delegate. 
  str = strOp("This is a test."); 
  Console.WriteLine("Resulting string: " + str); 
  Console.WriteLine(); 
      
  strOp = RemoveSpaces; // use method group conversion 
  str = strOp("This is a test."); 
  Console.WriteLine("Resulting string: " + str); 
  Console.WriteLine(); 
 
  strOp = Reverse; // use method group converison 
  str = strOp("This is a test."); 
  Console.WriteLine("Resulting string: " + str); 
}
