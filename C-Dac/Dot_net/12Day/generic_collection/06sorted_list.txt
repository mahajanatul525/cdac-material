SortedList represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys and are accessible by key 

. The capacity of a SortedList object is the number of elements the SortedList can hold. 


As elements are added to a SortedList, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation.


SortedList<TKey, TValue> uses less memory than SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>.
