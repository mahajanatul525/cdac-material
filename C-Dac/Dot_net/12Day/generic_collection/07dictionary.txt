Represents a collection of keys and values.

The Dictionary<TKey, TValue> generic class provides a mapping from a set of keys to a set of values. Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value and its associated key. 

Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class is implemented as a ---hash table.

Every key in a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> must be unique according to the dictionary's equality comparer. A key cannot be null, but a value can be, if the value type TValue is a reference type.


order the items are enumerated doesn't necessarily match with the order with which the items were added to the Hashtable.
The order in which the items are returned is undefined.
