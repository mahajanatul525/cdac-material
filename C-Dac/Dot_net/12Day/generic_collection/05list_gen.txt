Represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. Provides methods to search, sort, and manipulate lists.

The List<T> is not guaranteed to be sorted. You must sort the List<T> before performing operations (such as BinarySearch) that require the List<T> to be sorted.

Elements in this collection can be accessed using an integer index. Indexes in this collection are zero-based.

For very large List<T> objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the enabled attribute of the configuration element to true in the run-time environment.

List<T> accepts null as a valid value for reference types and allows duplicate elements.
