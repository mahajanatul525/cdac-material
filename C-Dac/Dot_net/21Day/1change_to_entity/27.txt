 Customizing the autogenerated create view
  

In this we will discuss, customizing the auto-generated create view. P

At the moment, none of the fields on "Create" view are required. This means,when you click on the "Create" button without filling any data, NULL values are stored in all the columns of tblEmployee table.

So, how to make these fields on the "Create" view required?

Add [Required] attribute to the "Employee" class. The "Employee" class that is present in "EmployeeDataModel.Designer.cs" is auto-generated by the entity framework. There is no point in adding the [Required] attribute to this class, as we will loose the changes if the class is auto-generated again. 


  

To achieve this, add a class file with "name=Employee.cs" to "Models" folder.

Copy and paste the following code in "Employee.cs" file
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace MVCDemo.Models
{
    [MetadataType(typeof(EmployeeMetaData))]
    public partial class Employee
    {
    }

    public class EmployeeMetaData
    {
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public string Gender { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public string City { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [Display(Name="Department")]
        public int DepartmentId { get; set; }
    }
}

At this point, run the application and click on the "Create" button without filling any data. Notice that we get validation error messages as expected. In a later  session, we will discuss changing the colour of the validation messages.

If you want "Select Department" as the first item in the "Department" dropdownlist on "Create" view, then, 
REPLACE THE FOLLOWING LINE
@Html.DropDownList("DepartmentId", String.Empty)

WITH
@Html.DropDownList("DepartmentId", "Select Department")

Notice that, a textbox is used for gender. It is ideal to have a dropdownlist for gender rather than a textbox. To achieve this, make the following changes to "Create.cshtml" view.

REPLACE THE FOLLOWING CODE
@Html.EditorFor(model => model.Gender)

WITH
@Html.DropDownList("Gender", new List<SelectListItem>
{
new SelectListItem { Text = "Male", Value="Male" },
new SelectListItem { Text = "Female", Value="Female" }
}, "Select Gender")
