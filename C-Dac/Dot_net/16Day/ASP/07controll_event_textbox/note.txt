 we will discuss about control level events. ASP.NET server controls, such as TextBox, Button, and DropDownList has their own events. For example, Button has a click event. TextBox has TextChanged event, and DropDownList has SelectedIndexChanged event. We have a set of asp.net validation controls, that has validation events. The events that all these controls expose, can be broadly divided into 3 categories.

Postback events - These events submit the Web page, immediately to the server for processing. Click event of a button control is an example for PostBack event.

Cached events - These events are saved in the page’s view state to be processed when a postback event occurs. TextChanged event of TextBox control, and SelectedIndexChanged event of a DropDownList control are examples of cached events. Cached events can be converted into postback events, by setting the AutoPostBack property of the control to true.
