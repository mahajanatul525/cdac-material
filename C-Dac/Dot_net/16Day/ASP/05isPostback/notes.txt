IsPostBack is a Page level property, that can be used to determine whether the page is being loaded in response to a client postback, or if it is being loaded and accessed for the first time. 

In real time there are many situations where IsPostBack property is used. For example, consider the webform used to register employee details. A sample form that we will use for this example is shown below. The form has First Name, Last Name and City fields.
