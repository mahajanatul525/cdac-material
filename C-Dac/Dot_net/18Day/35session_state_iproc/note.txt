Session State Mode
InProc
StateServer
Custom



InProc session state mode: When the session state mode is set to InProc, the session state variables are stored on the web server memory inside the asp.net worker process. This is the default session state mode.

to run asp.net project it has to run inside executabel  
executable file 

asp.net worker process w3wp.exe

rightckick start task bar
process -show all proc ess
//process recyceling

restart wroker process
refresh webform2.aspx which is reading  session data it will loos data from session



dvantages of InProc session state mode:
1. Very easy to implement. All that is required is, to set, the session state mode=InProc in web.config file.
2. Will perform best because the session state memory is kept on the webserver, within the ASP.NET worker process(w3wp.exe).
3. Suitable for web applications hosted on a single server.
4. Objects can be added without serialization

Dis-advantages of InProc session state mode:
1. Session state data is lost, when the worker process or application pool is recycled.
2. Not suitable for web farms and web gardens.
3. Scalability could be an issue.

Note: 
Web Garden - Web application deployed on a server with multiple processors
 
Web Farm - Web application deployed on multiple server
