Points to remember about session state variables:
1. Session state variables are stored on the web server by default, and are kept for the life time of a session.

2. The default session state mode is InProc. 

3. The life time of a session is determined by the timeout value in web.config file. The default is 20 minutes. The time-out value can be adjusted according, to your application requirements.


<sessionState mode="InProc" timeout="30"></sessionState>
4. Session state variables are available across all pages, but only for a given single session. Session variables are like single-user global data.

5. It is always a good practice to check, if a session state variable is null before calling any of its methods, such as ToString(). Otherwise, we may run into runtime NullReferenceExceptions.
