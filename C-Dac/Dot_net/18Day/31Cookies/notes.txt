Just like QueryStrings, Cookies can also be used to send data from one webform to another. In general, web sites use cookies to store user preferences or other information that is client-specific. Cookies store small amounts of information on the client’s machine.






Cookies can be broadly classified into 2 types
1. Persistent cookies - Remain on the client computer, even after the browser is closed. You can configure how long the cookies remain using the expires property of the HttpCookie object.

2. Non-Persistent cookies - If you don't set the Expires property, then the cookie is called as a Non-Persistent cookie. Non-Persistent cookies only remain in memory until the browser is closed.
