The following says that the strong type used for the model is _05entity.Models.Employee

@model _05entity.Models.Employee


This basically declares the 'variable' Model as that type. It's akin to doing the following:

_05entity.Models.Employee.   Model;

@Model.EmployeeId

Model is a variable, 

@model is a keyword saying what type Model will be
