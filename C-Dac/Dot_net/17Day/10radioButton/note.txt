Radio Button control is used, when you want the user to select only one option from the available choices. For example, the gender of a person. A person can be Male or Female. He cannot be both. So, if the user has first selected Male, and if tries to select Female, the initial Male selection he made should automatically get de-selected. Another example, would be when you want the user to select his or her favourite colour.

In short, if you want to provide the user with mutually exclusive options, then choose a Radio Button Control.



Important Properties of the Radio Button Control
