create a table Module with
	id  int
	name	varchar
	duration  int
	fees	int

add atleast 5 records.

write a spring MVC application where,

using Reverse Engineering generate an Entity "Module".

as soon as application starts u need to show all the modules with name,duration and fees. along with this also show a link "delete".

when user clicks on "delete" , that particular record should be deleted and control should come to the same jsp page.

[ for any doubt , refer "Sixth_Example_delete_hyperlink" example from "with form" ]
